# tobitober

"TobiTober" was a school project about a decade ago back in 2004. I wrote the code, 2 others made the images, sounds and story. It was built with BlitzBasic [1].
Some years laters, i learned some more things at the university and had fun building a second version prototype "TobiReloaded" with javascript based on CraftyJS [2], but sadly i never get it finished.
